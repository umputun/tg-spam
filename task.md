# WebUI Configuration Management Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

1. Updated the settings.html template to make all tabs editable when in ConfigDBMode:
   - Spam Detection tab
   - Meta Checks tab
   - OpenAI Settings tab
   - Lua Plugins tab
   - Data Storage tab
   - Bot Behavior tab
   - System tab

2. Implemented form handling in config.go:
   - Updated the `updateSettingsFromForm` function to handle all form fields
   - Fixed parsing of super users from comma-separated strings
   - Added proper type conversions for numeric fields

3. Added REST endpoints for configuration management:
   - `POST /config/save`: Save current configuration to database
   - `POST /config/load`: Load configuration from database
   - `PUT /config`: Update configuration in memory (and optionally save to DB)
   - `DELETE /config`: Delete configuration from database

## Current Issues

There's an issue with the authentication middleware in the webapi.go file. The application uses two different authentication methods:
- `rest.BasicAuth` for API access which takes a function that checks username and password
- `rest.BasicAuthWithPrompt` for Web UI which takes direct username and password strings

We were trying to update the code to handle both plain password and bcrypt hash authentication properly, but ran into some issues with the middleware application.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the authentication middleware implementation:
   - Update the `webUI.Use` call to use `rest.BasicAuthWithPrompt` correctly
   - Check compatibility with tests

2. Run tests to ensure everything works correctly:
   - `go test -race ./app/webapi/...`

3. Run linters to check for any code quality issues:
   - `golangci-lint run`

4. Test the UI functionality to make sure form submission works:
   - Test each tab's editable fields
   - Test saving and loading configuration

5. Add comprehensive error handling for form submissions

6. Update documentation if needed
